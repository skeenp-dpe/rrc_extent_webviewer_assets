    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>
    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 15,000 ML/d at Yarrawonga Weir.
        The mapping shows the upper limit of inundation at this flow rate (light blue) plus an inundation extent that
        would be more typically experienced when environmental flow releases are made (dark blue). Two extents are shown
        to demonstrate that inundation outcomes associated with investigated flow releases will be variable in response
        to catchment conditions and will typically be less than the upper limit.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (low infiltration and
        evaporation losses), and flows are held at this level for an extended duration. Environmental flow releases to
        this inundation extent under this flow limit option will be infrequent or
        rare.</p>

    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>
    <p>The frequency of managed environmental flows enabled by the program (ie higher flows greater than 15,000 ML/d to
        water wetlands and low-lying floodplain, as mapped here) would vary over time depending on water availability,
        climate and ecological conditions. On average, over the long-term, the program anticipates these higher
        environmental flow deliveries would occur about 4 to 5 years per decade, comprising some smaller events and some
        larger events up to the flow limit. These flows would include some new events and some events that extend the
        duration of existing unregulated events using water for the environment. These higher environmental flow
        deliveries would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.</p>
    <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October, with river rises occurring
        slightly later in downstream areas as these flows move through the system. Occasionally, and when conditions are
        appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in June to July, or slightly later in November (December in
        downstream areas). Deliveries in November would be infrequent, and mostly involve augmenting an existing
        unregulated flow event to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk.</p>
    <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to 7 to 21 days at the peak flow rate,
        followed by a gradual reduction in flows back to background flow levels. Occasionally, and when conditions are
        appropriate, lower flows (eg 15,000 to 30,000 ML/d) may be delivered for up to 30 days.</p>
    <p><strong>Assumptions regarding Goulburn River flows</strong></p>
    <p>Flows from the Goulburn River have a significant effect on flows in the Murray downstream of the Goulburn
        junction and through Koondrook-Perricoota Forest and parts of the Wakool River system (including Barbers, Thule
        and Merran Creeks). The modelling undertaken by RRCP has allowed for coincident high flows in both the Murray
        and Goulburn Rivers that would be associated with either managed flows up to the flow limits being investigated
        in both valleys, or managed high flows in the Murray coincident with unregulated flows in the Goulburn (noting
        that environmental flow deliveries would avoid conditions when there is elevated risk of exceeding the agreed
        flow limits). Accordingly, the modelling allows for high flows at Torrumbarry and through watercourses
        downstream of the Goulburn junction. The modelling is conservative and most managed flows would achieve lower
        flows than those modelled and mapped here.</p>
    <p>For all model scenarios the modelling has assumed the Torrumbarry cutting channel into Koondrook-Perricoota
        Forest would remain closed and Swan Lagoon regulators would be open.</p>
