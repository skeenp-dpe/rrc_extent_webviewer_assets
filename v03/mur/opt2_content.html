    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>
    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 25,000 ML/d at Yarrawonga Weir.

    </p>
    <p>The mapping shows two extents:
    <ul>
        <li>upper limit of inundation for this flow limit option (light blue)<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>an inundation extent more typically experienced when these higher environmental flow deliveries are made
            (dark blue)<sup>2</sup></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These extents show the inundation outcomes for the flow options being investigated vary depending on catchment
        conditions and would be less than the modelled upper flow limit in most cases.</p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (with low infiltration and
        evaporation losses) and flows are held at this level for an extended duration, substantially greater than the
        normal duration environmental flow releases would occur. Environmental flow releases causing this inundation
        extent across the full length of the river system would be infrequent or rare. Assumed flows at this level for
        gauges across the project area are shown in Table 1, below.</p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>The more typical inundation extent shows an inundation extent more frequently experienced under this
        flow limit option, under more typical catchment conditions and environmental flow release durations. </p>
    <p><strong>Flow rates and gauge heights</strong></p>
    <p>Flow rates and gauge heights for the upper limit inundation extent across this project area are shown in Table 1,
        below. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Table 1:</b> Flow rates and gauge heights</p>
    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>

    <p>The proposed frequency of managed environmental flows under the Reconnecting River Country Program (i.e., flows
        greater than 15,000 ML/d and up to the upper flow limit) would vary over time depending on water availability,
        climate and ecological conditions. </p>
    <p>Over the long-term, it is anticipated these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur on average about
        four to five years per decade, comprising some smaller events and some larger events up to the flow limit. </p>
    <p>Flows would include some new events and some events extending the duration of existing unregulated events using
        water for the environment. They would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.
    </p>
    <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October, with river rises occurring
        slightly later in downstream areas as these flows move through the system. Occasionally, and when conditions are
        appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in June to July, or slightly later in November (December in
        downstream areas). </p>
    <p>Deliveries in November would be infrequent and would mostly involve adding to an existing unregulated flow event
        to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk. </p>
    <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to seven to 21 days at the peak flow rate
        (in some years this would be the upper flow limit; in some years smaller flows would be delivered). This would
        be followed by a gradual reduction in flows back to background flow levels. </p>
    <p>Occasionally lower flows (e.g., 15,000 to 30,000 ML/d) may be delivered for up to 30 days to support the health
        of low-lying wetlands and waterbird breeding events.</p>

    <p><strong>Assumptions regarding Goulburn River flows</strong></p>
    <p>Flows from the Goulburn River have a significant effect on flows in the Murray River system downstream of the
        Goulburn junction, through the Koondrook-Perricoota Forest and parts of the Wakool River system (including
        Barbers, Thule and Merran Creeks). </p>
    <p>The programâ€™s modelling allows for concurrent high flows in both the Murray and Goulburn Rivers associated with
        either managed flows up to the flow limits being investigated in both valleys, or managed high flows in the
        Murray concurrent with unregulated flows in the Goulburn (noting higher flow deliveries would avoid conditions
        where there is an elevated risk of exceeding the agreed flow limits).</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the modelling allows for high flows at Torrumbarry and through watercourses downstream of the
        Goulburn junction. The modelling is conservative and most managed environmental flows under the program would be
        lower than those modelled and mapped here.</p>
    <p>For all scenarios the modelling has assumed the Torrumbarry cutting channel into the Koondrook-Perricoota Forest
        would remain closed and Swan Lagoon regulators would be open. </p>
