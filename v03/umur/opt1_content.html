    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>
    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 25,000 ML/d at Doctors Point.
        The mapping shows the upper limit of inundation at this flow rate (light blue) plus an inundation extent that
        would be more typically experienced when environmental flow releases are made (dark blue). Two extents are shown
        to demonstrate that inundation outcomes associated with investigated flow releases will be variable in response
        to catchment conditions and will typically be less than the upper limit.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (low infiltration and
        evaporation losses), and flows are held at this level for an extended duration. Environmental flow releases to
        this inundation extent under this flow limit option will be infrequent or rare.
    </p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>The more typical inundation represented on the maps is the extent of the inundation that may be
        expected for most environmental flow releases under this flow limit option.</p>

    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>
    <p>The frequency of managed environmental flows enabled by the program (ie higher flows greater than 15,000 ML/d to
        water wetlands and low-lying floodplain, as mapped here) would vary over time depending on water availability,
        climate and ecological conditions. On average, over the long-term, the program anticipates these higher
        environmental flow deliveries would occur about 4 to 5 years per decade, comprising some smaller events and some
        larger events up to the flow limit. These flows would include some new events and some events that extend the
        duration of existing unregulated events using water for the environment.â€¯These higher environmental flow
        deliveries would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.</p>
    <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October</p>
    <p>Occasionally, and when conditions are appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in June to July, or
        slightly later in November. Deliveries in November would be infrequent, and mostly involve augmenting an
        existing unregulated flow event to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk.</p>
    <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to 7 to 21 days at the peak flow rate,
        followed by a gradual reduction in flows back to background flow levels. Occasionally, and when conditions are
        appropriate, lower flows (eg 15,000 to 30,000 ML/d) may be delivered for up to 30 days.</p>
