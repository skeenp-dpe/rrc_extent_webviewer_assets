    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>
    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 25,000 ML/d at Doctors Point.

    </p>
    <p>The mapping shows two extents:
    <ul>
        <li>upper limit of inundation for this flow limit option (light blue)<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>an inundation extent more typically experienced when these higher environmental flow deliveries are made
            (dark blue)<sup>2</sup></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These extents show the inundation outcomes for the flow options being investigated vary depending on catchment
        conditions and would be less than the modelled upper flow limit in most cases.</p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (with low infiltration and
        evaporation losses) and flows are held at this level for an extended duration, substantially greater than the
        normal duration environmental flow releases would occur. Environmental flow releases causing this inundation
        extent across the full length of the river system would be infrequent or rare. Assumed flows at this level for
        gauges across the project area are shown in Table 1, below.</p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>The more typical inundation extent shows an inundation extent more frequently experienced under this
        flow limit option, under more typical catchment conditions and environmental flow release durations. </p>
    <p><strong>Flow rates and gauge heights</strong></p>
    <p>Flow rates and gauge heights for the upper limit inundation extent across this project area are shown in Table 1,
        below. </p>

    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>

    <p>The proposed frequency of managed environmental flows under the Reconnecting River Country Program (i.e., flows
        greater than 15,000 ML/d and up to the upper flow limit) would vary over time depending on water availability,
        climate and ecological conditions. </p>
    <p>Over the long-term, it is anticipated these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur on average about
        four to five years per decade, comprising of some smaller events and some larger events up to the flow limit.
    </p>
    <p>Flows would include some new events and some events extending the duration of existing unregulated events using
        water for the environment. They would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October. Occasionally, and when
        conditions are appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in June to July, or slightly later in
        November. </p>
    <p>Deliveries in November would be infrequent and would mostly involve adding to an existing unregulated flow event
        to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk. </p>
    <p>The duration of the higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to seven to 21 days at the peak flow rate.
        In some years, this would be the upper flow limit, while in other years smaller flows would be delivered. This
        would be followed by a gradual reduction back to background flow levels.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, lower flows (e.g., 15,000 to 30,000 ML/d) may be delivered for up to 30 days to support the health
        of low-lying wetlands and waterbird breeding events.</p>

    <p><strong>Inflows from the Ovens and Kiewa rivers</strong></p>
    <p>Environmental water releases from Hume Dam will continue to consider inflows from the Kiewa River to ensure the
        agreed flow limit at Doctors Point is not exceeded during environmental releases. Similarly, river operators
        will continue to consider inflows from the Ovens River, in combination with Murray flows (Hume Dam releases
        combined with Kiewa River inflows), to ensure the agreed flow limit downstream from Yarrawonga weir is not
        exceeded. </p>
