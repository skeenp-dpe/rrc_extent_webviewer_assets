    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>

    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 40,000 ML/d at Wagga Wagga. The mapping shows the upper limit of inundation at
        this flow rate (light blue) plus an inundation extent that would be more typically experienced when
        environmental flow releases are made (dark blue). Two extents are shown to demonstrate that inundation outcomes
        associated with investigated flow releases will be variable in response to catchment conditions and typically
        less than the upper limit.</p>

    <p style="color:red">FTP placeholder</p>

    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (low infiltration and
        evaporation
        losses), flows are held at this level for an extended duration, and tributary flows are relatively high.
        Environmental flow releases to this inundation extent under this flow limit option will be infrequent or rare.
    </p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>The more
        typical inundation represented on the maps is the extent of the inundation that may be expected for most
        environmental flow releases under this flow limit option.</p>

        <p><sup>3</sup>Flow rates and gauge heights throughout this project area are shown in the table below.</p>

        <p style="color:red">For sites further downstream from Yarrawonga the flow rates shown reflect upper-end estimates that would be associated with long duration flows at Yarrawonga during relatively wet catchment conditions. Most environmental flow deliveries would result in lower flow rates or gauge heights than those modelled.</p>
        <p style="color:red">Flows from the Goulburn River have a significant effect on flows in the Murray downstream of the Goulburn junction and through Koondrook-Perricoota Forest and parts of the Wakool River system (including Barbers, Thule and Merran Creeks). The modelling undertaken by RRCP has allowed for coincident high flows in both the Murray and Goulburn Rivers, and therefore high flows through these watercourses downstream of the Goulburn junction.&nbsp; Alignment in peak flows from managed environmental water deliveries in the Murray and Goulburn Rivers would be an infrequent occurrence and most managed flows would achieve lower flows than those modelled.</p>
        <p style="color:red">For all model scenarios the modelling has assumed the Torrumbarry cutting channel into Koondrook-Perricoota Forest would remain closed and Swan Lagoon regulators would be open.&nbsp; In some situations it is expected that the Torrumbarry cutting channel would be used extend the duration of inundation of parts of the forest once high flows recede, but remain closed during high river flows.</p>
