    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>

    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 36,000 ML/d at Wagga Wagga.
        The mapping shows the upper limit of inundation at this flow rate (light blue) plus an inundation extent that
        would be more typically experienced when environmental flow releases are made (dark blue). Two extents are shown
        to demonstrate that inundation outcomes associated with investigated flow releases will be variable in response
        to catchment conditions and will typically be less than the upper limit.</p>

    <p><strong>Flow, timing and duration</strong></p>
    <p style="color:red">FTP placeholder</p>


    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>


    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (low infiltration and
        evaporation losses), and flows are held at this level for an extended duration. Environmental flow releases to
        this inundation extent under this flow limit option will be infrequent or rare.
    </p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>The more typical inundation represented on the maps is the extent of the inundation that may be
        expected for most environmental flow releases under this flow limit option.</p>

    <p style="color:red">For sites further downstream from Yarrawonga the flow rates shown reflect upper-end estimates
        that would be associated with long duration flows at Yarrawonga during relatively wet catchment conditions. Most
        environmental flow deliveries would result in lower flow rates or gauge heights than those modelled.</p>
    <p style="color:red">Flows from the Goulburn River have a significant effect on flows in the Murray downstream of
        the Goulburn junction and through Koondrook-Perricoota Forest and parts of the Wakool River system (including
        Barbers, Thule and Merran Creeks). The modelling undertaken by RRCP has allowed for coincident high flows in
        both the Murray and Goulburn Rivers, and therefore high flows through these watercourses downstream of the
        Goulburn junction.&nbsp; Alignment in peak flows from managed environmental water deliveries in the Murray and
        Goulburn Rivers would be an infrequent occurrence and most managed flows would achieve lower flows than those
        modelled.</p>
    <p style="color:red">For all model scenarios the modelling has assumed the Torrumbarry cutting channel into
        Koondrook-Perricoota Forest would remain closed and Swan Lagoon regulators would be open.&nbsp; In some
        situations it is expected that the Torrumbarry cutting channel would be used extend the duration of inundation
        of parts of the forest once high flows recede, but remain closed during high river flows.</p>
