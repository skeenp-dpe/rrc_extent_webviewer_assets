    <p><strong>Details
        </strong></p>
    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 22,000 ML/d at Wagga Wagga.
        The mapping shows the upper limit of inundation at this flow rate (light blue) plus an inundation extent that
        would be more typically experienced when environmental flow releases are made (dark blue). Two extents are shown
        to demonstrate that inundation outcomes associated with investigated flow releases will be variable in response
        to catchment conditions and will typically be less than the upper limit.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (low infiltration and
        evaporation losses), and flows are held at this level for an extended duration. Environmental flow releases to
        this inundation extent under this flow limit option will be infrequent or
        rare.</p>

    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>
    <p>The frequency of managed environmental flows enabled by the program (ie higher flows greater than 22,000 ML/d to
        water wetlands and low-lying floodplain, as mapped here) would vary over time depending on water availability,
        climate and ecological conditions. On average, over the long-term, the program anticipates these higher
        environmental flow deliveries would occur about 4 to 5 years per decade, comprising some smaller events and some
        larger events up to the flow limit. These flows would include some new events and some events that extend the
        duration of existing unregulated events using water for the environment. These higher environmental flow
        deliveries would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.</p>
    <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October. Occasionally, and when
        conditions are appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in May to July, or extend slightly later
        into November. Deliveries extending into November would be infrequent, and mostly involve augmenting an existing
        unregulated flow event to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk.</p>
    <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to 5 days at the peak flow rate, followed
        by a gradual reduction in flows back to background flow levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Assumptions regarding Billabong Creek flows</strong></p>
    <p>Managed environmental flows in the Murrumbidgee River associated with these flow limit options would contribute
        flows into Yanco Creek and subsequently into Billabong Creek via Colombo Creek. Managed environmental flows that
        reach Billabong Creek through Colombo Creek would be small relative to flows originating from the Billabong
        Creek catchment upstream of Colombo Creek. The Billabong Creek catchment upstream of Colombo Creek would remain
        the primary contributor of high flows in Billabong Creek through the Project area.</p>
    <p>There is however potential for these managed environmental flows to coincide with high flows originating from the
        Billabong Creek catchment. The modelling has allowed for up to 2,300 ML/d contribution from the unregulated
        Billabong Creek upstream of Colombo Creek (including via the Nowrannie Creek anabranch), which is approximately
        the 90th percentile flow during the period August to October when managed environmental flow deliveries would
        occur. This allows for managed environmental flow deliveries under a wide range of conditions whilst noting that
        managed environmental flow deliveries would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood
        risk.</p>
