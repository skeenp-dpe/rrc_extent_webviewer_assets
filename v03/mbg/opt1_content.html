    <p><strong>Details

    <p>This option is for a flow limit of 22,000 ML/d at Wagga Wagga.</p>
    </p>
    <p>The mapping shows one extent:
    <ul>
        <li>upper limit of inundation for this flow limit option (light blue)<sup>1</sup></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This extent shows the inundation outcomes for the flow options being investigated vary depending on catchment
        conditions and would be less than the modelled upper flow limit in most cases.</p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment conditions are wet (with low infiltration and
        evaporation losses) and flows are held at this level for an extended duration, substantially greater than the
        normal duration environmental flow releases would occur. Environmental flow releases causing this inundation
        extent across the full length of the river system would be infrequent or rare. Assumed flows at this level for
        gauges across the project area are shown in Table 1, below.</p>
    <p><strong>Flow rates and gauge heights</strong></p>
    <p>Flow rates and gauge heights for the upper limit inundation extent across this project area are shown in Table 1,
        below. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Table 1:</b> Flow rates and gauge heights</p>
    <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>
    <p>The proposed frequency of managed environmental flows under the Reconnecting River Country Program (i.e., higher
        flows greater than 22,000 ML/d and up to the upper flow limit) would vary over time depending on water
        availability, climate and ecological conditions. </p>
    <p>Over the long-term, it is anticipated these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur on average about
        four to five years per decade, comprising some smaller events and some larger events up to the flow limit. </p>
    <p>Flows would include some new events and some events extending the duration of existing unregulated events using
        water for the environment. They would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.
    </p>
    <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October. Occasionally, and when
        conditions are appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly earlier in May to July, or extend slightly later
        into November. </p>
    <p>Deliveries extending into November would be infrequent and would mostly involve adding to an existing unregulated
        flow event to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic blackwater risk.</p>
    <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to five days at the peak flow rate (in
        some years this would be the upper flow limit; in some years smaller flows would be delivered) and would be
        followed by a gradual reduction in flows back to background flow levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Inflows from tributaries upstream of Wagga Wagga </strong></p>
    <p>Environmental water releases from Burrinjuck Dam will continue to consider inflows from the Tumut River
        (including Blowering Dam releases), together with inflows from unregulated tributaries such as Jugiong Creek and
        Tarcutta Creek, to ensure the agreed flow limit at Wagga Wagga is not exceeded during environmental releases.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assumptions regarding Billabong Creek flows</strong></p>
    <p>Managed environmental flows in the Murrumbidgee River associated with these flow limit options would contribute
        flows into Yanco Creek and subsequently into Billabong Creek via Colombo Creek. Managed environmental flows
        reaching Billabong Creek through Colombo Creek would be small relative to flows coming from the Billabong Creek
        catchment upstream of Colombo Creek. </p>
    <p>The Billabong Creek catchment upstream of Colombo Creek would remain the primary contributor of high flows in
        Billabong Creek. However, there is potential for these managed environmental flows to coincide with high flows
        coming from the Billabong Creek catchment. </p>
    <p>The modelling allows for up to a 2,300 ML/d contribution from the unregulated Billabong Creek upstream of Colombo
        Creek (including via the Nowrannie Creek anabranch), which is approximately in the 90th percentile flow during
        the period from August to October when managed environmental flow deliveries would occur. </p>
    <p>This allows for managed environmental flow deliveries under a variety of conditions while noting managed
        environmental flow deliveries would not occur during extreme wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.
