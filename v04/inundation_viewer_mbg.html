                <p>Welcome to the Reconnecting River Country Program (RRCP) inundation interactive map. The map provides
                    access to the program's modelled outputs showing potential inundation for the flow rates being
                    investigated.</p>
                <p>This app focuses on the Murrumbidgee River between the Burrinjuck Dam and its confluence with the
                    Murray River, including the Yanco Creek system. The default flow option displayed in the app is
                    22,000 ML/d at the Wagga Wagga gauge, which is the current temporary operational limit.</p>
                <p><strong class=subheading>Whats new</strong></p>
                <p>The interactive map has been updated to simplify and improve the inundation information presented.
                    The updates include:</p>
                <div class=div-indent> <strong>June 2023</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minor changes around Buckingbong Depression to reflect updated modelling</li>
                    </ul> <strong>Feb 2023</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Model zones merged to provide seamless mapping for each project area</li>
                        <li>Modelled levees and embankments have been added to the mapping</li>
                        <li>Modelled flows at gauges are now provided in table form to allow easier viewing</li>
                        <li>Gauge board diagrams added for some gauges. Remaining gauges will be added in the future
                            once analysis is complete</li>
                        <li>Additional text added to the banner to describe potential frequency, timing, and duration of
                            flows</li>
                        <li>Additional text added to describe assumptions regarding Billabong Creek inflows</li>

                <p>The mapping shows the extent of inundation, including the presence of water under road, highway and

                    is overlain over aerial imagery which may appear to show bridges as being overtopped by water, but
                    may actually represent water under the bridges.</p>

                            options being investigated vary depending on catchment conditions and would be less than the
                            modelled upper flow limit in most cases.</p>
                        <p id=lgn_upper_desc></p><sup>1</sup>The upper limit inundation extent assumes catchment
                        conditions are wet (with low infiltration and evaporation losses) and flows are held at this
                        level for an extended duration, substantially greater than the normal duration environmental
                        flow releases would occur. Environmental flow releases causing this inundation extent across the
                        full length of the river system would be infrequent or rare.</p>
                        <p id=lgn_typical_desc><sup>2</sup>The more typical inundation extent shows an inundation extent
                            more frequently experienced under this flow limit option, under more typical catchment
                            conditions and environmental flow release durations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Frequency, timing and duration</strong></p>
                            <p>The proposed frequency of managed environmental flows under the Reconnecting River
                                Country Program (i.e., higher flows greater than 22,000 ML/d and up to the upper flow
                                limit) would vary over time depending on water availability, climate and ecological
                                conditions.</p>
                            <p>Over the long-term, it is anticipated these higher environmental flow deliveries would
                                occur on average about four to five years per decade, comprising some smaller events and
                                some larger events up to the flow limit.</p>
                            <p>Flows would include some new events and some events extending the duration of existing
                                unregulated events using water for the environment. They would not occur during extreme
                                wet conditions when there is elevated flood risk.</p>
                            <p>Most of these higher environmental flow deliveries would occur from August to October.
                                Occasionally, and when conditions are appropriate, deliveries might occur slightly
                                earlier in May to July, or extend slightly later into November.</p>
                            <p>Deliveries extending into November would be infrequent and would mostly involve adding to
                                an existing unregulated flow event to improve environmental outcomes or manage hypoxic
                                blackwater risk.</p>
                            <p>The duration of these higher environmental flow deliveries would be up to five days at
                                the peak flow rate (in some years this would be the upper flow limit; in some years
                                smaller flows would be delivered) and would be followed by a gradual reduction in flows
                                back to background flow levels.</p>
                            <p><strong>Inflows from tributaries upstream of Wagga Wagga </strong></p>
                            <p>Environmental water releases from Burrinjuck Dam will continue to consider inflows from
                                the Tumut River (including Blowering Dam releases), together with inflows from
                                unregulated tributaries such as Jugiong Creek and Tarcutta Creek, to ensure the agreed
                                flow limit at Wagga Wagga is not exceeded during environmental releases.</p>
                            <p><strong>Assumptions regarding Billabong Creek flows</strong></p>
                            <p>Managed environmental flows in the Murrumbidgee River associated with these flow limit
                                options would contribute flows into Yanco Creek and subsequently into Billabong Creek
                                via Colombo Creek. Managed environmental flows reaching Billabong Creek through Colombo
                                Creek would be small relative to flows coming from the Billabong Creek catchment
                                upstream of Colombo Creek.</p>
                            <p>The Billabong Creek catchment upstream of Colombo Creek would remain the primary
                                contributor of high flows in Billabong Creek. However, there is potential for these
                                managed environmental flows to coincide with high flows coming from the Billabong Creek
                                catchment.</p>
                            <p>The modelling allows for up to a 2,300 ML/d contribution from the unregulated Billabong
                                Creek upstream of Colombo Creek (including via the Nowrannie Creek anabranch), which is
                                approximately in the 90th percentile flow during the period from August to October when
                                managed environmental flow deliveries would occur.</p>
                            <p>This allows for managed environmental flow deliveries under a variety of conditions while
                                noting managed environmental flow deliveries would not occur during extreme wet
                                conditions when there is elevated flood risk.</p>
